This file:
- creates the server
- sets basic rules
- connects all system parts

It is the central place where everything is joined.

## Reading Input

The server can read:
- structured messages
- plain text messages

This makes it flexible and easy to use.

## Connecting System Parts

Each system feature lives in its own file.

This file connects:
- execution
- metadata
- dictionary
- syntax checking
- transport
- debugging

All parts work together,
but stay separate.

## Why This Is Important

Without this file:

- parts cannot talk to each other

With this file:
- everything is connected
- responsibilities are clear
- the system can grow safely
