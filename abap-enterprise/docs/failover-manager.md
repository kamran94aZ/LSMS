# Failover Manager – Very Simple Explanation

This file helps the system **stay calm** when something goes wrong.

If one part stops working,
the system continues.

---

## Big Idea

Imagine a team.

If one person leaves:
- the team does not stop
- the work continues
- a new leader may be chosen

This file makes that happen.

---

## What This File Does

This file:
- notices when someone is missing
- removes them from the list
- chooses a new leader if needed

It keeps the system alive.

---

## Detecting a Problem

When a member disappears:
- the system is informed
- this file reacts

Nothing is ignored.

---

## Removing the Missing Member

The system:
- looks at the current list
- removes the missing one
- works with who is left

This avoids confusion.

---

## Choosing a New Leader

If leadership is affected:
- a new leader is selected
- order is restored

The system always has direction.

---

## Why This Is Important

Without failover:
- one failure stops everything
- users are affected

With failover:
- failures are handled quietly
- the system stays stable

---

## Comparison With SAP

SAP systems:
- automatically react to server failures
- continue processing

This file follows the same idea,
in a simpler form.

---

## Summary

This file:
- handles unexpected problems
- protects stability
- keeps the system running

It does not prevent failures,
but it manages them.
