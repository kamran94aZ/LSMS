# Metadata API – Simple Explanation

This file helps the system **describe itself**.

It does not run programs.
It explains what the system knows and understands.

## Big Idea

Imagine a school.

To understand the school, you may ask:
- What subjects exist?
- What classes exist?
- What roles exist?
- What can each role do?

This file answers the same kind of questions for the system.

---

## What This File Does

This file opens doors that allow asking:

- What words does the system know?
- What tables exist?
- What main objects exist?
- What actions does one object support?

The answers are simple and readable.

---

## Keywords

This part shows:
- the words the system understands
- the language rules

It is like showing the alphabet of the system.

---

## Tables

This part shows:
- what data structures exist
- what containers are available

It is like showing shelves in a library.

---

## Classes

This part shows:
- what main concepts exist
- what roles the system understands

It is like listing all people in a school.

---

## Class Methods

This part shows:
- what one specific concept can do
- what actions are available

It is like asking:
“What can this person do?”

---

## Why This Is Important

Without metadata:
- the system is silent
- UI cannot prepare screens
- users cannot explore capabilities

With metadata:
- the system explains itself
- screens can be generated
- trust is increased

---

## Comparison With SAP

In SAP systems, metadata is used heavily by Fiori.

This file follows the same idea:
- but in a simpler
- clearer
- more open way

---

## Summary

This file:
- explains what the system knows
- helps build user interfaces
- makes the system understandable

It does not execute logic,
but it gives meaning to the logic.

---

## Next Step

Each file in this system has a purpose.

When the next file is ready,
it can be explained the same way.
