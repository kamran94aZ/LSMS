# Transport API – Simple Explanation

This file manages changes.

It makes sure that changes:
- are collected
- are reviewed
- are moved safely

Nothing happens by accident.

---

## Big Idea

Imagine moving houses.

You do not carry items one by one.
You pack them in boxes.
You label the boxes.
You move them carefully.

This file does the same for changes.

---

## What This File Does

This file:
- creates change packages
- closes them when ready
- moves them to another place

Each step is controlled.

---

## Creating a Transport

A transport is a box.

When a change is made:
- a new box is created
- the owner is written
- the reason is written

---

## Releasing a Transport

When the change is finished:
- the box is closed
- no more changes are allowed

This protects stability.

---

## Migrating a Transport

After release:
- the box can be moved
- changes reach another system

This keeps systems in sync.

---

## Why This Is Important

Without transport control:
- changes are lost
- systems break
- no one knows who did what

With transport control:
- everything is tracked
- systems stay stable
- responsibility is clear

---

## Comparison With SAP

SAP systems rely heavily on transports.

This file follows the same idea:
- but in a simpler
- clearer
- modern way

---

## Summary

This file:
- controls change movement
- protects system stability
- builds trust

It does not execute business logic,
but it protects the system.
