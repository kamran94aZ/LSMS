# Syntax Check API – Simple Explanation

This file checks if a program is written correctly.

It does not run the program.
It only looks for mistakes in the writing.

---

## Big Idea

Before reading a letter,
you check if the words make sense.

Before running a program,
you check if it is written correctly.

This file does exactly that.

---

## What This File Does

This file:
- receives program text
- checks if it follows the rules
- returns the result

Nothing more.
Nothing less.

---

## How It Works

A program is sent to the system.

The system:
- looks at the text
- checks the rules
- reports problems if they exist

---

## Why This Is Important

Without syntax checking:
- programs crash
- errors appear later
- problems are harder to find

With syntax checking:
- mistakes are caught early
- programs are safer
- users trust the system

---

## Comparison With SAP

In SAP systems:
- syntax is checked before execution

This file provides the same behavior
in a simpler and open way.

---

## Summary

This file:
- protects the system
- prevents bad input
- improves reliability

It does not execute logic,
but it protects the logic.
