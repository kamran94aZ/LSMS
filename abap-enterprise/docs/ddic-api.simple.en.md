## Big Picture (Before We Start)

Imagine a big company.

In this company:
- there are many lists
- many names
- many rules
- many definitions

Someone must know:
- what lists exist
- what is inside each list
- what each name means

In SAP systems, this place is called **DDIC**.

In this project, this file does the same job.

It is like a **dictionary** for the system.

## What Is This File For?

This file opens **doors**.

These doors allow other people or programs to ask questions like:
- “What tables exist?”
- “What is inside this table?”
- “What rules exist?”
- “What elements exist?”

The answers are sent back in a simple format.
