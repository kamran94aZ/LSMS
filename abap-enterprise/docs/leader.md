## Big Idea

Imagine a group of people working together.

Every group needs:

- members
- one leader
- clear rules
- agreement

This file creates a simple way to choose that leader.

## What This File Does

This file:

- knows its own member
- collects all members
- applies a clear rule
- selects one leader
- shares the same result with everyone

The rule is simple and predictable.

## Leader Selection

One member is chosen as leader.

The rule is:

- all member names are collected
- names are ordered
- the first name becomes leader

This rule:

- is fair
- never changes
- is easy to understand

## Leader Role

The leader:

- represents the group
- coordinates actions
- keeps order

Other members:

- recognize the leader
- follow the same decision

---

## Leader Check

Each member checks:

- “Am I the leader?”

If yes:

- it leads

If no:

- it follows

No discussion is needed.

## Why This Works

This approach:

- removes guessing
- avoids conflicts
- keeps behavior consistent

All members reach the same conclusion independently.

## Comparison With SAP

SAP systems work across many servers.
