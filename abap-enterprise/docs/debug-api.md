# Debug API – Simple Explanation

This file is about **watching a program while it runs**.

Sometimes programs do not work as expected.
To understand why, we need to stop, look, and move step by step.

This file makes that possible.

## Big Idea

Imagine a child solving a math problem.

You can:
- tell the child to stop
- look at one step
- skip a step
- go back
- or let the child continue alone

This file gives the same control over a program.

## What This File Does

This file creates control doors for debugging.

Through these doors, we can:
- stop the program at a specific place
- move step by step
- go inside a step
- go out of a step
- continue normally

---

## Breakpoints

A breakpoint means:

“Stop here.”

When a breakpoint is added, the program remembers:
- this place is important
- stop when you reach it

---

## Step Controls

There are different ways to move:

- Step Into  
  Look inside what is happening

- Step Over  
  Skip details and move forward

- Step Out  
  Leave the current block and go back

- Resume  
  Stop debugging and continue normally

---

## Why This Is Important

Without debugging:
- programs are black boxes
- mistakes are hidden

With debugging:
- programs become understandable
- mistakes can be found
- logic can be trusted

## Comparison With SAP

In SAP systems, this role is done by the ABAP Debugger.

This file follows the same idea:
- but in a simpler
- more open
- web-based way

## Summary

This file:
- gives control over program execution
- allows step-by-step understanding
- helps build reliable systems

It is a small file,
but it gives very strong power.
