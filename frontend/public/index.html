            <h1>Mashine Learning System</h1>
            <section>
                <h2>Mashine Learning Technics and Lab AI</h2>
                <p>
                    Artificial Intelligence (AI) is a broad field of computer 
                    science focused on creating systems
                    capable of performing tasks that typically require human intelligence.
                    These tasks include problem-solving, understanding language, recognizing patterns, and making decisions.
                    Within this wide domain, Machine Learning (ML) plays a central and highly influential role.
                    Machine Learning is a subset of AI that enables computers to learn from data rather than relying on strictly programmed instructions.
                    Instead of telling a system exactly what to do, ML algorithms identify patterns and relationships in large datasets and use this knowledge to make predictions or decisions.
                    This ability to learn and improve over time makes ML one of the most powerful tools in modern AI development.
                    The connection between AI and ML is therefore both practical and foundational.
                    AI provides the overarching goal—creating intelligent systems—while ML offers the methods and techniques to achieve that goal.
                    Today, many of the most advanced AI applications, such as speech recognition, image classification,
                    recommendation systems, and autonomous vehicles, depend heavily on machine learning algorithms,
                    especially deep learning.
                    In summary, AI is the broader concept of intelligent machines,
                    and machine learning is the key approach that allows these machines to learn,
                    adapt, and perform complex tasks with increasing accuracy.

            <h2>LIMS Systems and AI</h2>
            <section>
                <h3>LIMS System between AI Solutions Relationships</h3>
                <p>
                    Laboratory Information Management Systems (LIMS) are essential tools for organizing, tracking, and managing laboratory data and workflows. 
                    With the integration of Artificial Intelligence (AI), LIMS platforms are becoming more efficient, accurate, and predictive. 
                    AI algorithms can analyze large volumes of laboratory data to identify patterns, detect anomalies, and improve decision-making. 
                    This enhances quality control, accelerates research processes, and reduces human error. 
                    As a result, the combination of LIMS and AI brings smarter automation and significantly improves laboratory productivity. 
                    Together, they lay the foundation for more advanced, data-driven scientific environments.

                <h1>Deep Learning Process and LIMS systems</h1>
                <p>
                    Deep Learning systems can significantly enhance the capabilities of Laboratory Information Management Systems (LIMS) by analyzing large and complex scientific datasets with high accuracy. 
                    When integrated with LIMS, deep learning models can automatically detect patterns, classify samples, and predict experimental outcomes. 
                    This allows laboratories to optimize workflows, reduce manual errors, and accelerate research processes. 
                    Deep learning also enables real-time anomaly detection, improving data quality and compliance. 
                    Overall, the combination of LIMS and deep learning creates a more intelligent, efficient, and data-driven laboratory environment.
